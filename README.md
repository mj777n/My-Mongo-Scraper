# Welcome to "My Mongo Scraper"
# All the News That's Fit to Scrape

### Overview
This full-stack app gives you the news from the New York Times Technology section. 
At the click of a button your news articles will be listed all on a single page - showing the Title and a snipit from the article with a link to the full article itself. 
You'll also be able to add your own comments and notes directly linked to your favorite articles. The notes are saved into a Mongoose database for others to view and add additional comments on as well.

1. The app will scrape and display the following information for each article:

     * Headline - the title of the article
     * Summary - a short summary of the article
     * URL - the url to the original article


### The directory structure is as follows

* The root directory file name is "My-Mongo-Scraper"
 - The same name as the github repository name for the app
